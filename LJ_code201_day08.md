# LJ Code 201 - Day 8  

Today was probably the hardest day. It was hard to not feel discouraged after going nowhere for 2 hours. Stepping away from the computer, talking to people helped me see the easier answer that was almost "hidden" under my eyes (thanks Sam for telling us to not use innerHTML!).  
Overall I think my code looks alright and is working, I also was able to do the stretch goal of modifying stores with some help from google.  

Useful thing I learned today:  
I learned that when I feel like I'm not going anywhere, I need to step away and stop perseverating in the same direction. It's also useful to talk to people and have a different perspective.  
I also learned about type coercion in forms, which was useful to debug my issue with 0.  
I used splice for the first time.  

Thing I nailed today:  
I finished the lab. I almost thought I wouldn't. The mood in class wasn't the greatest and I think I was affected by it. I persevered and after taking my mind off it, I got it.  
I'm pretty happy with the modify feature and being able to figure it out by myself was probably the most satisfying part of my coding day.
