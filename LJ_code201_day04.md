# LJ Code 201 - Day 4  

Today's lecture was really interesting. It was nice to review functions, which I feel comfortable with for now and it was really helpful to go over the html&CSS layout.  
Borders, margins, padding are MUCH clearer now.  
It was also my first time pair programming. I had never written code with somebody else before and at first it was pretty difficult to be just the navigator but after a little bit I feel that Britney and I made a good team.  

Useful thing I learned today :  
Britney went over my code and corrected all the typos with me, the linter didn't catch anything after I installed it!
I also learned a lot more about using git in collaboration with other, which I had never done. I can see how git is going to be our number one tool in the future.  

Things I nailed :
The JS assignment was relatively easy. I even had time to fix some of Britney's code.  
I also had the opportunity to walk her through my code and give her the info to improve her own. She also gave me good feedback on my code.
