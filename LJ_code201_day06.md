# LJ Code 201 - Day 6  

Today we talked about domain modeling and the DOM before working on objects.
Today's lab assignment was probably the most challenging so far but when I got stuck I started looking around and went to the first group I saw who seemed stuck at the same spot.  
Turned out the three of us had different pieces oef the puzzle and we more or less finished together (although Lee left at some point because some things weren't clear for him I believe).  
I was able to finish in about 30 minutes at home so that's great!  
I was also able to start on the index page.  

Useful thing I learned today :  
using javascript to write directly in the browser was neat.
using a method to push the data generated in an array that is a value of one property of an object was an interesting challenge.  

Thing I nailed today:  
I am pleased my understanding of the problem was validated. I sketched a lot before I started coding and as a result I knew exactly what I wanted my object to look like and what my methods were supposed to do. I just needed to work the "talk in javascript" part and Adrian and Lee were helpful for that.  
We managed to have a finished object before Sam did the "tip session".
I was able to work with more than one person. Working in a group is a personal challenge for me and I am making extra efforts since I started Code Fellows, so I count this as a mini-victory.
