# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

Today was the first day of project week.
I feel like we have made really good progress and that we have been able to work together quite well.
I didn't do as much html as I wanted to do and I wish I could have done the javascript by myself but that's what teamwork is!
I am really happy my teammates are excited about the project. It's not a glamorous one but I really think it's a good one. I know by experience how parents can feel when they take this test and they are met with more questions than answers and zero support.

Useful thing I learned:
It was interesting to figure out a way to capture the radio buttons value. Figured out the scoring.

Thing I nailed today:
Got the radio buttons values and figured out the pseudocode for pre-checking the radio buttons for test-review
