# LJ Code 201 - Day 1  

Today was really heavy. The most challenging part was to break away from the python logic. My brain really wanted to use a for in loop to iterate through my array but javascript does not work that way and it took me a while to see it.  
I got to use for loops and while loops, which was fun AND frustrating at the same time.  
I also used booleans in my loops which I haven't done much of before.  
I should have taken more breaks instead of trying to persevere because after a break the solution came easily.  

Useful thing I learned today:  
Your while loop can have two conditions.  
You can make an ordered list inline by floating left and adjusting the margins.  
I should take more breaks.
I struggle less at CSS if I just try to move stuff around and see what happens. I shouldn't be afraid to do that more. Worst case scenario I have to go back to an earlier commit.   

Things I nailed:  
Once I talked it through out loud I was able to break out my loops in a much clearer way and my code looked way less confusing.  
I managed to not use break even though it was my first instinct.  
It didn't take me 4 hours to figure out the css for my ordered list.
