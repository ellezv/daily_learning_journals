# LJ Code 201 - Day 17  

Today was pretty overwhelming! When I arrived this morning I felt our top priority was to sort our javascript mess. We did, it was tedious and sometimes nerve wracking ("Are we breaking everything right now?") but oh so worth it. Our code might not be as DRY as I would like but it is SO MUCH cleaner.  
We then decided to redo a whole feature and it took us forever to figure it out. We worked on it with three brains, even four when Sam came to help us and gave me fresh eyes on it.  
We tried a billion different thing that were "almost working" when I decided to flip the entire logic and starting thinking about it in a whole different way. Rachael met me half way and had the brilliant idea to grab the buttons in two separate arrays. I decided "fuck it, I can figure it out" and ran with it and it worked! It was pretty overwhelming and I hadn't realized until then how stressed out I was before. After that, EVERYTHING was easy. Seriously. Everything.  
I'm super happy with the way our website looks and most importantly (to me) I'm super happy it works!
