# LJ Code 201 - Day 2  

Today's most challenging part was the CSS layout. It was pretty hard to visualize what I wanted to do with my page and think of ways to organize it well enough it would convey the information I wanted out there efficiently.
I got to experiment with floats and try and try again to rearrange my boxes. Frustrating but good practice. It was nice to remember to take a break. It was also nice to have the "ahah!" moment when everything fell in line.

Useful thing I learned today :  
unordered lists have padding that you can override in CSS. You can easily see it using dev tools. Thanks to Aaron who let me figure it out by myself!

Thing I nailed today :  
The javascript part came easily. I am happy I arranged my code so it looked much cleaner than expected. I remember to test for different user input scenarios and changed my code accordingly. I thought about while loops to improve my script.
With encouragement from classmates and Sam I remembered to take a break.
