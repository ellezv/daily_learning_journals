# LJ Code 201 - Day 15  

Day 15 was a great day. Lots of useful thing to learn with Brian and Aaron. I'm much more clear on "this" (Not a pun. Seriously.) and going through the whole CSS involved in building a page was great. I feel less lost in CSS.  
Then group work, which was awesome. I'm very excited to work on this project as it is a topic close to my heart and something that comes up almost every time I meet other autism families. I wish there had been something like this when in January I googled at 2AM "does my son have autism". That would have changed many things.  

Useful thing I learned:  
All the CSS. All of the topics Aaron introduced.  

Thing I nailed:  
I wouldn't say I nailed it but presenting my idea to the whole class was hard and I did it anyway. I hate public speaking.
