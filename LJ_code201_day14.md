# LJ Code 201 - Day 14  

today was really interesting and even though it wasn't the regular kind of lecture we had so far, I learned a ton!  
Aaron introduced some "advanced" javascript concepts, some of which I had been wondering about (especially prototypes and inheritance) so that was fun.  
Then Brian did a demo of css layout and I learned so so much! It was much easier to do the markup for the afternoon assignment after two lectures with Brian!
Then labs and group programming. I didn't feel like I learned a whole lot about git but I think running into merge conflict before and having made some mistakes in my workflow in the past forced me to google quite a lot of my problems and encouraged me to have good practice early on. Also, Git makes a lot of sense to me and I like it so it helps too!  

Useful thing I learned today:  
Pretty much both lectures with Brian and Aaron were good stuff I will try to practice and research some more.  
It was also good to have a first feel of what it's going to be like to work with me teammates, Rachael and Judy.  

Thing I nailed today:  
Git. I was on top of thing during the group programming and helped solve every issue we ran into.
