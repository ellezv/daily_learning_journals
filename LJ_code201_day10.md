# LJ Code 201 - Day 09  

Today was pretty hard. An assignment that was not easy got a lot harder when we ended up working with three people instead of two. This was a considerable challenge, especially after a mentally exhausting week. I had a really hard time and I wanted to give up. I didn't, thanks to Fiona.  
I am definitely not happy with my work or how I handled the social situation and I'm going to leave it at that.  
It's really hard to really reflect on my work so far as I feel I am not getting adequate feedback. I feel like a lot of people are praised for good work while I don't really know what I am doing right and what I am doing wrong.  
I understand that maybe I don't give the impression of struggling. Being part of a class and trying to fit in is harder than writing javascript for me.
I will keep working as I have for now.  

Useful thing I learned today:  
Some proper git flow.  

Thing I nailed today:  
nothing in class. Class was a disaster.  
I went home and added a delete store function. I also read about databases and what I would need to store my modified array and also how I could keep password data to access my sales page and pseudo-coded it for ulterior use (when we learn about that.)
