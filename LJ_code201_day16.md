# LJ Code 201 - Day 16  

Today was the first day of project week. I feel pretty good about what we have accomplished so far.  
It was interesting to work together with Rachael and Judy as we all have different styles but I think it was overwhelmingly positive.  
I didn't do as much HTML as I probably should have but I had a lot of the content ready for my teammates this morning while I had to go to the autism center for my son.  

It was a shitty day on a personal level but it didn't get the best of me and I was able to play my part in the group fully.
