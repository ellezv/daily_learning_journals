# LJ Code 201 - Day 19  

Today was a good day. We achieved a lot of our stretch goals. Looking back, it seems our project was fairly "easy" but looking closely at the things we accomplished, I feel like our project wasn't that easy. When we started, we had a very clear picture of what we wanted to accomplish and I had thought about most of the logic for quite a while before even pitching this project. I am really impressed by my teammates PM skills and coding skills and I am certain that without them, their brilliant ideas and brilliant mind, we wouldn't have done it.
Me, I was just doing the javascript.
