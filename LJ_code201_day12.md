# LJ Code 201 - Day 11  

Today was good. Debugging was interesting, it's really a part of code that I like as much I hate. Trying to understand what you want to happen and what your code is doing instead is a fascinating puzzle (also I am saying that because Aaron taught it and he grades my journal).  
Brian's lecture on CSS was really really good. He put simple words and simple examples on concept I thought I understand but I struggled with nonetheless. It really rocked my CSS world.  
Labs were fine. It took me probably 30 minutes to finish it.  
Great conversation with Aaron (again, he grades my journal) and Munir (who gave me an awesome pep talk).  
I was then able to help Rachel as much as I could in fixing her code and walking her through the duplicate/sequence-repetition logic. I really hope it was helpful to her because she worked really hard and she totally got it, even if her piece of code doesn't work 100%.  

Useful thing I learned today:  
indexOf() returns -1 when the value is not in the array. Duh. (I didn't know). Super useful!  

Thing I nailed today:  
I didn't fall asleep on the table.  
So. Tired.
