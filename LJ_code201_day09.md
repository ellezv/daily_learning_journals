# LJ Code 201 - Day 09  

Today was mostly CSS and html. Today was a disaster.  
The only good part about today was that I was able to fix my modify feature on my store table in just a few minutes.  
The bad part was that once it was done, I had to do my index.html.  

Useful thing I learned today :  
today I learned I hate CSS and I never want to do it on a daily basis. I don't mind handling the front-end stuff in javascript but the styling and designing parts are not for me.  

Thing I nailed today:  
I didn't pack my thing and go, which I wanted to do.  
I finished the modify function and helped Britt, Bronwyn and Lee get it.
