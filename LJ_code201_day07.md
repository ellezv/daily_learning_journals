# LJ Code 201 - Day 7  

   Today was packed with info. Overall it went ok and I feel like I got a good grasp on object constructors and how to build tables with javascript. I feel like it's the day I have learned the most so far.  
   Definitely getting to that point in the class where I feel like my head is going to explode with new information to process.   

   Useful thing I learned today :  
   Build tables with javascript using data from objects. Pretty awesome! I love learning about ways to store and use data.  

   Thing I nailed today:  
   The object constructor took me only a few minutes so that was great. Building the table was ok as well and I was able to finish lab early. I also got some of the stretch goals.
