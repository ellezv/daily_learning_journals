# LJ Code 201 - Day 1  
  
I learned stuff. That was cool.  
Sam said "weird" a lot.  
It was nice to help Sera with the terminal because it allowed me to put words on what I had learned, I feel even more comfortable navigating directories and moving stuff around now.  
It was also my first time putting javascript in html and even though we didn't do it the "regular way" (ie. js as it's own document and not in my html page) it was pretty cool to finally see everything put together, even at a very basic level.
