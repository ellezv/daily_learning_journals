# LJ Code 201 - Day 13  

Today I missed the lecture. Then I showed up for labs and wasn't able to focus enough on anything. I sketched some pseudocode, went home and took a nap.  
I went through some notes classmates handed me and did some extensive googling and was sort of able to finish my lab.  

What I learned today:  
I can't code if I'm stressed-out. Sometimes it's ok to sit one out. I'll do better tomorrow.
