# LJ Code 201 - Day 17  

Today was as productive as expected. We managed to figure out a lot of things we expected would take a while. We are right on tracks for our project which is frankly quite a great feeling!  
Still navigating the ins and outs of team work. Sure is interesting. I really hope I am not stepping on any toes as I know it's one of my weaknesses and I'm really trying to be mindful.  
Overall I feel really good about our project and my team.  
Motion to change name of team Death to team Awesome.
