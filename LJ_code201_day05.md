# LJ Code 201 - Day 5  

Today work on function was pretty awesome. I think I had good foundations on functions but I learned a ton anyway! It gave me several ideas on how to improve my existing piece of code so that was pretty neat.  
Very helpful to learn about appropriate resources.  
Git was super cool. I realized that the tutorial I did before was super helpful and I have an appropriate understand for my level (not a git goddess yet.)  
Lab was suuuuper interesting.  

Useful thing I learned today :  
Even if it's tempting, don't write functions for everything.  
Resources like MDN vs W3.  
Neat stuff about increment operator.  
Lots of cool stuff about arrays.  

Thing I nailed today :  
I didn't struggle with git and that was a relief.  
"sum(sum(a,b)[0],c)[0]" was oddly satisfying to figure out!
