# LJ Code 201 - Day 11  

Today was pretty awesome. It was interesting to work on code review as I really enjoy seeing how others decide to solve a problem. Fascinating and also really helpful to get other point of views.  
Assignment went fairly well. I was pretty intimidated by the amount of work at first and all the layers I could perceive but not grasp yet. Thankfully I started working with Lee and Adrian and we tackled the first part really quickly. Once I felt more comfortable with the problem the logic came fairly easily and the pseudo-code almost wrote itself.  

Useful thing I learned today:  
Figuring out how to target clicks on specific pictures was an interesting problem. Rachael was doing something different and it gave me a good "aha" moment that allowed me to get my answer. That was pretty neat.  


Thing I nailed today:
The logic part of the problem came really easily and I'm happy I came up with an answer quickly. I off course could vastly improve my code (hello DRY), but the quick and dirty works pretty well for now! After the debacle the second part of last week was (css...), it felt really good to be getting it again.
